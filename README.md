# VAC-Voice-Activated-Car
A voice-controlled RC car built using the MFNR Web Stack (MongoDB, Flask, Node.js, React). The project starts with a simulated RC car in the Gazebo Environment and will later transition to a physical RC car powered by Raspberry Pi. This project aims to integrate real-time voice commands with advanced robotics control.
